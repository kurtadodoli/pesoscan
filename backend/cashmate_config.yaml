# Philippine Peso Classes (expected in dataset)
classes:
  - "1_peso"
  - "5_peso" 
  - "10_peso"
  - "20_peso"
  - "50_peso"
  - "100_peso"
  - "200_peso"
  - "500_peso"
  - "1000_peso"

# Training Tips:
# - Start with yolov8n for faster experimentation
# - Increase batch_size if you have more GPU memory
# - Reduce batch_size if you get CUDA out of memory errors
# - Increase epochs for better accuracy (200-300 for production)
# - Monitor validation loss - stop if it stops improving
